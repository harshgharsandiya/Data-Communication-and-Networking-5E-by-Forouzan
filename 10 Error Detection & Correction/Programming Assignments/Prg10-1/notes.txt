#Prg10-1. - A programm to simulate the calculation of CRC.

Analysis -

Sender Side -

dataword = k bit
codeword = n bit
divisor  = n-k+1 bit (For generate redundant bit)
codeword = dataword + (augmented dataword % divisor)

Receiver Side -

syndrome = n-k bit
syndrome = codeword % divisor
if syndrome = 0 --> accept else reject dataword
