Program #10-4. A program to simulate the calculation of Adler checksum.

Checksum = 32 bit

Similar to Fletcher with 3 differences

1. Calculation done on single byte instead of 2 byte at a time.

2. Modulos is prime number (65,521) instead of 65,536.

3. R is initialized to 1 instead of 0.

Checksum - For 16-bit -
L: Left 16-bit checksum
R: Right 16-bit checksum
Di: Next 16-bit data itme

R=1, L=0
while more data:
    R = (R+Di) mod 65521
    L = (L+R) mod 65521
checksum = (L*65536) + R
