#Prg10-2. - A program to simulate the calculation of traditional checksum.

Analysis -

#Sender side

dataword = m bits (m bit units)
checksum = 1 bits (extra m bit unit)
codeword = n bits = dataword + checksum 
;checksum not necessary to add at the end only
;checksum calculated = one's complement addition of m bits data units

#Reciver side

checksum = calculate by received_codeword
if checksum == 0 then accepted else rejected
;;checksum calculated = one's complement addition of m bits received_codeword units
